# Covid-19-Data-Exploration-using-SQL

In this project, I analyzed and explored covid-19 data with SQL using Micrsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

This covid-19 contains information starting from  January, 2020 to April, 2021.


Below is the link to the tableau dashboard that I built to further to visualize the insights and trends derived from this analysis.
